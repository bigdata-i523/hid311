        The United States healthcare system is in crisis.  The cost is
        far higher than all other nations, and is exponentially
        increasing.  In addition, for all of this spendig, measured
        health outcomes are far lower than most other nations. Big
        Data driven technology solutions may help solve the healthcare
        crisis.

        The entirety of the human genome was sequenced in 2003,
        ushering in a new era of molecular biology, genetics and
        medicine.  Since that time, technologies have advanced
        significantly, and next generation sequencing allows
        increasingly rapid and affordable sequencing of the enitre
        human genome.  Beyond the human genome, we can also sequence
        the entire RNA transcriptome, proteome, and metabalome.  We
        can compare these entities in health and disease, and across
        populations.  These new technologies produce massive datasets.
        Big Data applications and analytics allow interpretation and
        utilization of these data sets.  However, analyzing and
        interpreting these datasets lags behind sequencing technology,
        as the rate limiting step. Still these technologies hold great
        potential for advancing medicine and human health.  Combining
        this omics data with the electronic health record, wearable
        technology, pharmaceuticals and procedures, moves us towards
        personalized, precision, medicine.
